# DEMOS2

Prototype Django based e-voting application, to demonstrate DEMOS2's client-side encryption e-voting.

The previous repository for DEMOS2 by Carey Williams can be found at: https://github.com/CareyJWilliams/DEMOS2

[//]: # (Not sure about this that was included in the readme: The Node.js encryption server depends on the milagro-crypto-js library. Download the source and follow the instructions for installation: https://github.com/milagro-crypto/milagro-crypto-js. To install, place the package's files (`package.json` level) into the directory Node/milagro-crypto-js (a new folder) then run `npm install` in the Node folder. This should install dependencies including the local package you just added.)
